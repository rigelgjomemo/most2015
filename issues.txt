Chapter 1. Introduction
We must differentiate our work from related work.
Adrienne Proter Felt's two papers are about a potential vulnerability
description. We also find the concrete exploits. Our tool can be used 
to find exploitable vulnerabilities. 

Chapter 2.
Running Example needed. 
Sections A and B are both about the same thing (Android communication system overview).
The system overview could be shorter.
Threat model could stem from the running example.
Goals need to be discussed (Analyzer and subsequent exploit generation as a proof of vulnerability). 
An approach overview with a high level description of what we do to warm up the reader: Analyze, find paths, 
automatically create exploits according to analysis results.

Chapter 3. Change name to Architecture, merge with Chapter 4
Divide the tool into components and change labels of Figure 2 (name according to
concepts, not implementation details).
There are two big components, analyzer and solver (can there be more?).
Describe each component in turn (challenges and solutions), using the 
running example as illustration.

Chapter 4. Implementation.
Here speak about Heros, Kaluza, the things done to speed up analysis.

Chapter 5. Results.
Describe a couple of applications in more detail (those whose vulnerabilities lead to good attacks)
Table needs to be described in a paragraph, what is Attacker Implications?
Discussion about defensive applications is OK.
